This App provide a method to complete the Stop Signal Task and Delay Discounting Task:

The Stop Signal Task presents participants with letter stimuli that require speeded motor responses. Reaction time and accuracy needs to be recorded and analysed. Performance is assessed using the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) measure, which represents the speed at which participants can accurately exhibit response inhibition. 

The Delay Discounting Task asks participants to make a series (of 27) choices between amounts of hypothetical money that differ on dimensions of size and delay of receipt. For example, would you $27 today or $54 in 31 days? By varying the dimensions orthogonally, the task provides a measure of temporal discounting that has been shown to be sensitive to impulsivity for reward in drug abusing groups, including binge drinkers.
